# Transliteration Models for Indian languages
These are models for transliteration involving Indian languages. 
The models are essentially Statistical Machine Translation systems trained using Moses over a
character-level parallel corpora of transliterations. Hence, you will need Moses to use these transliteration models.
The transliteration corpus has itself been mined in an unsupervised fashion from a translation corpus.
